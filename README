Description:
   This bundle atm just contains a syntax-highlighting for Graphviz.
   If I remember right, the Keywords are based upon the ones I found in
   http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation/dotguide.pdf and
   http://www.graphviz.org/cvs/doc/info/lang.html
   Hopefully everthing is included.
   
Links:
   - http://www.graphviz.org/ -- Main page.  If you search for
     docummentation about the DOT language, you can search there.
     
   - http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/ -- A OS-X GUI, very nice.
